Create a custom qualifier @MinNumber.

Use game.properties to specify the value for minNumber.

Create a bean method to create the bean minNumber (Tip: GameConfig).

Inject/Autowire minNumber to NumberGeneratorImpl.

Add a getter for minNumber to NumberGenerator.

Fix NumberGeneratorImpl to generate numbers between min and max (currently it generates between 0 and max).

Fix GameImpl to use minNumber for smallest and guess instead of using 0 as a starting value.
